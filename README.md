## Problem Statement üöß

- COVID Tracking and Escalation

## Background üìñ

As of 12th June, we have 298,283 Cases of COVID-19 reported in India, out of which 8,855 innocent people have lost their lives. Right now, as much as we require Healthcare Professionals giving their level best trying to save lives, we also require major technological advancements in the healthcare domain to overcome this situation caused by the Global Pandemic. Tracking probable suspects and Escalating investigation at this point of time seems to be the only way we can possibly flatten the curve and raise the line, by stopping further spread of Novel Coronavirus and helping those already affected recover at the earliest so we don't face more casualties. The Novel Coronavirus has four stages of transmission:
- Stage 1: First Appearance
- Stage 2: Local Transmission
- Stage 3: Community Transmission
- Stage 4: National Epidemic <br>

India has entered *Stage 3*, and there isn't much that we can do, except try our level best and stop further spreading of this deadly virus.

## About Our Product üîß
### What
We at Team codeBlooded, propose a Web Application which is preventive, personalized and affordable, **HopeVid**, that serves the purpose of Tracking and Escalation of COVID Suspects based on inputs provided by individuals voluntarily. We do not store any essential data and Security of the system is our priority. HopeVid provides a minimalist Interface which is both informational and analytical. 

With our Product you can reach out to available doctors, book tests or report possible suspects while also being up to date with the number of active cases in the country and around you. We also have a separate section for users who wish to know more about Coronavirus, wherein we have embedded Informational YouTube Videos, News Sources and Quizzes amidst other things. We expand HopeVid to a Mobile Application which is nothing but a webview of our Web Application built in React Native.

We allow the user to **track** their health visually by synthesizing data in the form of Vitals taken during the User's conversation with our Chatbot.

We also plan to have an in house Mental Assessment Quiz that will help the user stay happy and sane even when they are restricted to four walls.

### Why
With HopeVid, we aim at providing a better interface so users can be aware about the situation. Due to restrictions in movement and the lockdown currently we are under, most people are unable to consult physicians or book tests. Our Product HopeVid comes at aid as it connects individuals with doctors and pathology labs functional in the zone so the user can avail these priviledges without having to step out of their houses. We can integrate DRx, LabRx, ActiveRx, and PharmRx to provide better service in future. We provide better UI/UX in a small storage space as we provide a simple WebView of our Web App in a React Native Application.

### How
We have come up with STAE-C, which expands to Systematic Tracking and Escalation Checking for COVID. The Process Flow is in the following order:
- First the User reports about symptoms while having a conversation with our Chatbot.
- If the Chatbot confirms that the User is carrying significant symptoms, it refers the User to a Doctor.
- Data fed to the chatbot (Health Vitals) is used for visual representation for better Tracking. 
- The User can interact with the Doctor after booking an appointment and report about more symptoms and vital information.
- If the Doctor confirms that the User might be a probable patient of COVID-19, the Doctor suggests required tests for confirmation.
- HopeVid connects the User now to a Pathology Lab, wherein the User's sample can be taken for further evaluation.
- If the test results come positive, details of the user are shared with authorities for a better escalation.

The User's details like Address and Mobile Number are kept private. Only Name, Age, Area and other essential details are shared with the Doctor. Aforementioned details and the Email Address of the user are shared with the Pathology Lab to enable the User to view and connect with the Lab and vice versa. Only if the result is positive, all required details are shared with authorities.

This process reduces unwanted hastle by reducing the time and effort that needs to be put up by a user to test himself or herself for COVID. Users will be at ease to use the app irrespective of their age because of its simplicity and integration, all at one place, while boosting the efficiency in monitoring the situation.
